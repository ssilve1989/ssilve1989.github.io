As a software engineer at TuringsCraft, one of my roles was Lead FrontEnd Developer for an application redesign of the core product. In this role I drive what technologies are used, how to serve the application and ensuring quality of the code by constant code reviews. The technologies I chose for this were React and ES6 along with the Flux implementation, Redux.
