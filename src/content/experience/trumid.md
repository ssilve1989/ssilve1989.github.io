As a Principal Software Engineer at Trumid, I focus on developing highly scalable gRPC microservices in Node.js that power critical trading infrastructure. My role encompasses managing the developer experience ecosystem around Node.js and NestJS, creating reusable libraries and abstractions that enable teams to build robust, maintainable systems.

I provide technical leadership in establishing best practices for TypeScript and RxJS implementation across the organization. Additionally, I architected and built a comprehensive Risk Asset Management system that tracks real-time PNL and trading metrics, utilizing microservices architecture with gRPC for high-performance inter-service communication.
