Mount Sinai is a leader in healthcare and the largest healthcare system in New York City. Here I led a small team of around 5 developers. We supported a J2EE backed site to serve the content for all the hospitals that were part of the Mount Sinai healthsystem. This web application leveraged the OpenText WEM content management system. I created a custom Java API to interface with it to improve readability, redundancy and quality of the code used to serve the site. This API was critical as it allowed for more rapid development of custom JSP Views and allowed them to be more dynamic. I played a Full Stack role here dealing with all aspects of the web application including system management of the application servers.
