Digital Reasoning is a machine learning, data analytics company that provides insights into unstructured data that can help users reason about relationships and actions that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. As a Professional Services Engineer, I worked with the clients who use Digital Reasoning's software to process their unstructured Data and educate them on how to use the software to meet their goals. This included writing code in Groovy and Python that extracted, transformed and loaded the clients unstructured data at scale, and prepared it for processing by the core software. Efficient coding was critical here to make sure everything performed as fast as possible.
